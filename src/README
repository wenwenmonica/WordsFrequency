Implement a program to count the frequency of words in a text file. The text file is partitioned into N segments.
Each segment is processed by a separate thread that out- puts the intermediate frequency count for its segment.
The main process waits until all the threads complete; then it computes the consolidated word-frequency data based
on the individual threadsâ€™ output.


Solution:
Use the HashMap to store the frequency of words of each thread
1. Split the text into several segments;
2. Merge the results.

Input File: TestFile.txt
Source Code File: SingleCounter, WordCounter, and the main class is CountingProcess.

This Java Program is configurable. Two options are provided in the arguments: counting file name and number of threads.
The number of threads is 5 in the program, we can modify the number.
